class InclusiveKLObjective(VariationalObjective):
    """
    The class that represents the inclusive KL objective (:math:`KL(p\|q)`,
    i.e., the KL-divergence between the true posterior :math:`p` and the
    variational posterior :math:`q`). This is the opposite direction of
    the one (:math:`KL(q\|p)`, or exclusive KL objective) that induces the
    ELBO objective.

    An instance of the class can be constructed by calling :func:`klpq`::

        # klpq_obj is an InclusiveKLObjective instance
        klpq_obj = zs.variational.klpq(
            log_joint, observed, latent, axis=axis)

    Unlike most :class:`~zhusuan.variational.base.VariationalObjective`
    instances, the instance of :class:`InclusiveKLObjective` cannot be used
    like a Tensor or evaluated, because in general this objective is not
    computable.

    The only thing one could achieve with this objective is purely for
    inference, i.e., optimize it wrt. variational parameters (parameters in
    $q$). The way to perform this is by calling the supported gradient
    estimator and getting the surrogate cost to minimize. Currently there is

    * :meth:`rws`: The self-normalized importance sampling gradient estimator.

    So the typical code for doing variational inference is like::

        # call the gradient estimator to return the surrogate cost
        cost = klpq_obj.rws()

        # optimize the surrogate cost wrt. variational parameters
        optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate)
        infer_op = optimizer.minimize(cost,
                                      var_list=variational_parameters)
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            for _ in range(n_iters):
                _, lb = sess.run([infer_op, lower_bound], feed_dict=...)

    .. note::

        The inclusive KL objective is only a criteria for variational
        inference but not model learning (Optimizing it doesn't do maximum
        likelihood learning like the ELBO objective does). That means, there
        is no reason to optimize the surrogate cost wrt. model parameters.

        of the model.
